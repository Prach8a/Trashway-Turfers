*TRASHWAY TURFERS*
(when Subway Surfers meet sustainability)
Clean the Streets, One Sprint at a Time!

**Problem Statement:
Urban environments suffer from excessive litter due to a lack of public engagement with cleanliness campaigns. Most awareness campaigns don’t appeal to young audiences .Trashway Turfers tackles this through an interactive gaming experience that rewards eco-conscious behavior in a fun and meaningful way.

•Trash equals Treasure
•Cleanliness equals progress
•Real-world habits can be encouraged through digital fun.
Trashway Turfers is a 2D endless runner game built using Pygame, where players run through various environment(streets,parks,beaches),collecting trash as in-game currency while dodging obstacles.This immersive experience subtly educates players on the importance of waste collection and management.

•Trash as Currency:Collect trash and use it to buy in-game upgrades.
